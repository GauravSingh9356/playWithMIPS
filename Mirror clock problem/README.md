# The Mirror Clock

A general problem when we see into a mirror, every object's image is inverted. The same concept is used in this problem. When a clock's image is seen in mirror whwn placed side by side the time also gets inverted sidewards. 

Develop a program which takes input as a 12 hour clock, irrespective of AM or PM, and shows an output of the inverted time.

Example:
        
        Original time: 8 : 40
        Inverted  time: 3 : 20
