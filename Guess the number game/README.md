Who doesn't love to play games. But, developing a game is even more fun.

Start your game dev experience by developing a simple game in assembly language....Assembly language?...Yes!

In this game a SECRET array has been provided but can be only accessed by its indexes....the player can only give index as the input...and taking a number from the given array from its index, the player has to guess the number and has a chance of 5 times.

The max score is 5 and each time the player fails to guess it he/she loses 1 point.

Create this intresting game...BEST OF LUCK!!!
