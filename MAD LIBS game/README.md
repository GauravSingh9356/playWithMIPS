# playWithMIPS

Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game which consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime.

Well, this is a little different....A simple 3 line story is given, you need to complete the story by completing the code, you have to only code some code snippets which will simply take input.

Rest, sky is the limit... :)

It's your story, make it large :)
